Hangman is a classic word guessing game played by two or more players. Here's how it works:
1. Setup: One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and represents it with a row of dashes (one dash per letter). The other player(s) try to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters.
2. Guessing Letters: Players take turns guessing letters. If a guessed letter appears in the word, it's revealed in the correct position(s). If not, the player accumulates "mistakes."
3. Winning and Losing: The game continues until either:
   - The guessing player(s) correctly guess the entire word (earning points based on speed and remaining "balloons").
   - The guessing player(s) make too many incorrect guesses and the "hangman" figure is completed (resulting in a loss).
4. Tips & Strategies:
   - Start with vowelsâ€”they're common.
   - Remember the order of frequently used letters: "Etaoin shrdlu."
   - Break down phrases into individual words for easier guessing.
   - Be cautious not to run out of guesses!
